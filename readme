Welcome to the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

This is a single player game that pits the player against the computer.
The computer selects its choice based on a neural network.  

Here are the rules as stated by Sheldon Cooper:
Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors
Scissors decapitates lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock

And as it always has been

Rock crushes scissors
